# Tern
Tern is a travel app that gives a holistic view of unfamiliar places, reduces time unnecessarily commuting back and forth, increases the number of POIs you can do in a day, and allows the creation and sharing of more efficient itineraries.

It is built in native iOS using Swift, UIKit, Firestore, Google Sign In, FBSDKCoreKit, MVC architecture, Cocoapods, GitHub, and “just in time” onboarding, an intuitive workflow, and animated transitions to enhance the UX. 

Code is available upon request.
